<b>Streamline unit testing</b> in Dynamics CRM by faking the `IOrganizationService` to work with an in-memory context.

<b>Drive your development</b> by unit testing any plugin, code activity, or 3rd party app using the `OrganizationService` easier and faster than ever before.

<b>Note: To keep up to date with client-side unit testing version of this framework, please [have a look at this repo](http://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy-js) and samples in this other [sample code repo](http://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy-js-samples) </b>

Supports Dynamics CRM 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and Dynamics 365 (8.x and 9.x). <b>NOTE:</b> With the release of Dynamics 365 v9 we are changing the naming convention for new packages to match the major version.

## Semantic Versioning

The NuGet packages use semantic versioning like this:

    x.y.z  => Major.Minor.Patch
       
x: stands for the major version. The package is very stable so that's why the major version didn't change yet.

y: minor version. Any minor updates add new functionality without breaking changes. An example of these would be a new operator or a new fake message executor.

z: patch. Any update to this number means new bug fixes for the existing functionality. A new minor version might also include bug fixes too.

## Contributing

Please consider the below guidelines for contributing to the project:

* Priority: Given the overwhelming number of issues and pull requests, we'll review Pull Requests first, then any outstanding issues. We encourage you to resolve / extend issues by yourselves, as a community, and we'll prioritise those first because we know (as mantainers) the effort it takes. 

    Please do [fork](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/fork) the project and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/pulls)
    
    We'll thank you forever and ever. 

    If you don't know how to resolve something or are not familiar with pull requests, don't worry, raise the issue anyway. Those will be revised next.

* When raising an issue:

    * <u>**Please provide a sample unit test**</u> to reproduce any issues detected where possible. This will speed up the resolution.
    * Attach all generated early bound typed entities required (if you're using early bound).

* **If you're using the framework, please do [Star](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/star) the project**, it'll give more visibility to the wider community to keep extending and improving it.

## Donate 

*  If you're a business / company who delivers solutions on top of the Power Platform, you can help make OSS sustainable while getting more visibility by becoming a sponsor. Please [reach out to me](https://github.com/jordimontana82) for sponsorship enquiries.

## Roadmap

*  TODO:  Add support for date operators. See `ConditionOperator` implementation status [here](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/blob/master/FakeXrmEasy.Tests.Shared/FakeContextTests/FetchXml/ConditionOperatorTests.cs#L19-L110). Feel free to add missing ones!
*  TODO: Implement remaining CRM messages. To know which ones have been implemented so far, see `FakeMessageExecutor` implementation status [here](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy/tree/master/FakeXrmEasy.Shared/FakeMessageExecutors).
*  TODO: Increase test coverage.
*  **NEW!** I'm planning a 2.x version, this version will contain all the major improvements I always thought of adding but that will introduce considerable breaking changes. If you want to join a private preview list, let me know.
